1. Create simple ronin server from package.json
2. Run the server and use test data from test-server.txt file
3. Create, study dockerfile before you create and image


4a !!! for any docker command you need to run your docker local daemon so open up first and run on OS system

4. Create a docker image from CLI command (from your root project location)

        docker build --tag node-docker .

5. that should create docker image for you 
6 list all docker images you have in docker list 

    docker images

6. Run app from docker image (from desktop docker app)

7. Running containers:

    a docker container as the name implies will only run in the container and not outside of it but we can expose
    port that would be able to test that container is running with below command 

            docker run --publish 8000:8000 node-docker


    this means to run and publish port 8000 to outside port 8000 for the node-docker app


7b. IMPORTANT you need to kill/stop container session first on port (that you run before) to be able to go to the next point 

        docker container ls 'or' docker ps (to list running containers)
        docker stop 'containerId'


7a. Running container in DETACHED mode (mining the server run is not depending on terminal, the container will run independently and can be listed in the jobs in docker apps)

    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 node-docker

8. List containers with flags to show running, stopped ....

    docker ps -all, 

9 give a name to the container 

    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name rest-server node-docker


to do :

docker run versus docker compose

The key difference between docker run versus docker-compose is that docker run is entirely command line based, while docker-compose reads configuration data from a YAML file.


what is docker volume ?

Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container. The volumes are stored on the host, independent of the container life cycle. This allows users to back up data and share file systems between containers easily.
