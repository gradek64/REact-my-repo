  There are few aproaches to support modularity in javascript, to say the least. Node.js is using 
  common.js aproach with require('module') and modern javascript is using import 'module' natively now. 
  Unfortunatelly browser dont catch up since new javascript is released also node is not alwasy up to date. 
  Therefore We need to use compilers to make them work in the browser enviroment.

  1) run babel 
      it will compile es6 code to es5 common.js support by node.js
  2) run browsify 
      it will compile common.js code into ES5 browser
